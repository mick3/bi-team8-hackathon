# bi-team8 project July 2020 Hackathon

We wanted to come together as a team and create a website aimed at older folks who are safely socially distancing during this time. While they are doing so, our aim was to help them connect with the outside world (family and friends).

# UX
The styling of the visual aspects of this website are aimed at older people, hence, probably are accustomed to the layout of a newspaper or more traditional methods of layout. We took inspiration from the 1950's art and media world to design our layout as such.

The ideal client for the website is:
  English speaking
  Aged anywhere from 50 on up
  Has an extended family in which they would wish to communicate with or a community of people online
  
The goal of this project is to provide people affected by quarantine and social distancing with limited computer skill a collection of easy-to-understand guides/tutorials to improve their social online-connectivity skills.

# User Stories
User stories:
• As a user, I want to find information on each main-stream social media and their use.
• As a user, I want to find easy to understand guides/tutorials to set up an account with one/some of the main stream social medias.
• As a user, I want to find guides/tutorials to initiate and participate in chats and video conferencing.
• As a user, I want to find suggestions for groups and/or communities to get started.
• As a user I want to be able to find out how to set up an email account
• As a user I want to understand how email works and how to get the most out of it so that I can communicate with friends and family
• As a user I want to be able to learn and understand more about digital platforms but not be patronised
• As a user I want to learn more about smart speakers / assistants and how they might be useful in my day to day life
• As a user I want to understand more about digital banking and how secure it is to feel confident in adopting it

# Site Owner Goals:
• As a site owner we want to facilitate the use of social medias and communication platforms for people with low IT skills.
• As a site owner, we want to create an easy-to-understand series of guides and tutorials in getting started with and using social medias.
• As a site owner, we want to receive feedback, including:
• Evaluation of ease-of-use.
• Suggestions for improvements.
• As a site owner, we want our audience to connect with us on social media platforms.
• Provide a site that gives information about various aspects of living in the digital space
• Give clear, concise information in a tone that is on a level with the user, explaining any jargon
• Provide a way for a user to "test their knowledge" and provide content suited to their technical level i.e. if they have an email address, don't propose this as a tutorial to take

# Website Direction
For the website we have several stories that we used to develop the content of the site. These are:
##### As a user I would like to understand more about online security - i.e. email verification.
##### As a user I would like to be able to send a pictures / content to my family.
##### Getting set up with Digital Banking online.
##### As a user I want to understand how email works and how to get the most out of it so that I can communicate with friends and family + set account up.
##### As a user, I want to find guides/tutorials to initiate and participate in chats and video conferencing.
